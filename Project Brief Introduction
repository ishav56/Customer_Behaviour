🧠 Description:
In this project, I explored customer behavior across multiple categories such as 🧥 Clothing, 💻 Technology, 💍 Jewellery, 👜 Accessories, and more! The main goal was to analyze purchasing patterns, customer preferences, and engagement levels across different product segments.

🐍 Python (Pandas) – For data cleaning and preprocessing to make the dataset analysis-ready.
📊 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – To uncover hidden trends, correlations, and behavioral insights.
🗄 SQL – To write complex queries and extract meaningful patterns from large datasets.
📈 Power BI – To design an interactive dashboard highlighting KPIs, customer trends, and category-wise insights for better decision-making.

💡 Key Insights:

Identified top-performing categories driving maximum sales and engagement.

Discovered behavioral patterns in customers’ preferences across regions and demographics.

Designed visual KPIs to track performance and highlight category-wise growth opportunities.


✨ Outcome:
Transformed raw, unstructured data into actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard — providing a clear view of customer behavior across different categories.
